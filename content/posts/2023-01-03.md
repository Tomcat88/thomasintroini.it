I've been recently thinking about migrating from LastPass to BitWarden due to the recent [incident](https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/)  and how they are [ dealing with](https://www.wired.com/story/lastpass-breach-vaults-password-managers/).


The problem is that I had already created a BitWarden account and imported some of my passwords in 2020. So, when I imported all of my passwords (old and new) again I created lots of duplicates.

Luckily BitWarden offers a CLI and after playing with it a bit a find a way to move all the "old" passwords created in 2020 in another folder, which will be then deleted by me manually. I could went ahead and deleted all of those passwords but I just wanted to be sure that I'm not deleting something that it's not in the LastPass account.

The bash script is: 

```bash
bw list items --folderid "<SOURCE_FOLDER_ID or null>" | jq -c '.[] | select (.creationDate | startswith("2020")) | .folderId = "<DESTINATION_FOLDER_ID>"' | while read obj; do echo `bw edit item $(jq -r .id <<< "$obj") $(bw encode <<< "$obj")`; done;
```

It basically ask for the list of items in a specific folder (`null` in my case) taking only those created in 2020 and attaches the destination folder id by using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) and then cycle trough them and update via the BW cli once again one a the time.

It's not really fast since each of the item must be encoded and updated. In my case for ~90 items it took ~4 minutes.
